# Image-Classification-of-dogs-and-cats
This project utilizes the Cats vs Dogs dataset to classify binary images of cats and dogs. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was employed as the deep learning model, along with three traditional machine learning models: Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier, and SVM Classifier.

## Motivation
The CNN model was chosen due to its high effectiveness in classifying images and its widespread usage in the present-day world.

## Results
The CNN model outperformed the traditional machine learning models by a significant margin, indicating that deep learning models are more effective for this task.
